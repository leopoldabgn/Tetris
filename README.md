## Normal mode
### Rules
You have to try to fit as many pieces together as possible to form lines. When a line forms, it disappears directly and all the blocks above fall down.
The more lines you form, the faster the blocks get! The game then becomes much more difficult. If you can no longer form lines and a pile of blocks touches the top of the screen, you have lost!
### How to play
UP arrow : Rotate the block.  
LEFT/RIGHT arrow : move the block on the left/right.  
BOTTOM arrow : accelerates the fall of the block downwards.

### Break mode
### Rules
In this mode, it's the same principle as in normal mode. The difference is that the field is already half filled. Many blocks were misplaced from the start. It's therefore very hard to form lines and the difficulty is increased !
### How to play
Same as normal mode.
